CHANGELOG

01-09-2025
This is the first time I started making the game. I only coded in the lanes for the main game and left it there.

03-09-2025
I started work on the intro animation, creating a purple disk that rolls in to the center. So far I only made it roll in, overshoot and drop back into the center in a clunky way.

04-09-2025
I changed the way the disk rolls in and added a flash effect.
