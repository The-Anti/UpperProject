CHANGELOG

31-08-2025
This is the first time I started making the game. I only coded in the lanes for the main game and left it there.

02-09-2025
I started work on the intro animation, creating a purple disk that rolls in to the center. So far I only made it roll in, overshoot and drop back into the center in a clunky way.

03-09-2025
I changed the way the disk rolls in and added a flash effect.

04-09-2025
Added background, made disk spin in the middle of the screen and made it clickable

17-09-2025
Made the disk clickable, moving it to the left. Started work on the main menu functionality

20-09-2025
White tint now fades after starting animation has played. Purple play button moves out smoother when disk is pressed and has been readjusted.
