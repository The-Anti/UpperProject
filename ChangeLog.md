CHANGELOG

31-08-2025
This is the first time I started making the game. I only coded in the lanes for the main game and left it there.

02-09-2025
I started work on the intro animation, creating a purple disk that rolls in to the center. So far I only made it roll in, overshoot and drop back into the center in a clunky way.

03-09-2025
I changed the way the disk rolls in and added a flash effect.

04-09-2025
Added background, made disk spin in the middle of the screen and made it clickable

17-09-2025
Made the disk clickable, moving it to the left. Started work on the main menu functionality

20-09-2025
White tint now fades after starting animation has played. Purple settings button moves out smoother when disk is pressed and has been readjusted.

22-09-2025
Resized the settings button, added green play button and added text for both buttons.

23-09-2025
Added functionality to the Settings button, opening a side panel where the settings will be. Created a new file for the settings tab (called settingsTab.py) and linked it to Menu.py to reduce clutter and test out linking feature.

18-11-2025
Added toggle buttons for the ghost tapping and scroll direction

06-12-2025 (semi big update)
Added changeable keybinds to the game, allowing the user to customise them to whatever they want. The user can use (nearly) any key on their keyboard but have to have 4 unique keybinds. Added system to actually save the settings now, including saving the ghost tapping setting.
