HOW TO PLAY

As of now you cannot play this game, I will get rid of this message when it can be played. To play the rhythm game, download all the files onto your computer. You must have PyGame installed. When you have the files on your computer, go into RhythmGame.py and launch it.
This will allow you to play the game normally as all the other files will link to RhythmGame.py
